Enterprise Solutions Corporation ("Company") recognizes that employees may need time away from work for various personal, medical, or family reasons. This Employee Leave Policy establishes comprehensive guidelines for all types of leave available to employees. The Company is committed to providing competitive leave benefits that support employee well-being while maintaining business continuity and operational effectiveness.

1.2 Scope and Coverage
This Policy applies to all employees of the Company, including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees, unless otherwise specified. Eligibility for specific leave types may vary based on employment status, length of service, and hours worked.

SECTION 2: PAID TIME OFF (PTO)

2.1 PTO Overview
The Company provides a comprehensive Paid Time Off (PTO) program that combines vacation, personal days, and sick time into a single bank of paid leave. This flexible approach allows employees to use their time off as needed for any purpose, including rest, relaxation, personal business, illness, or medical appointments.
